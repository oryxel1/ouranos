## Ouranos - Minecraft Bedrock Protocol Translation

Ouranos (fork) is a library for Minecraft Bedrock Edition that enables players using any client version to connect seamlessly to
any server version by performing protocol-level translation without modifying the original server or client software.

- This is a fork that modified Ouranos for well... GeyserReversion! The code isn't great to looks at, there are a lot of
technical debt. The original project itself is still amazing tho!
